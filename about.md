Hey, I'm Ali, front-end developer from Istanbul, Turkey. I've been working at [VNGRS](http://vngrs.com).

### Education

I graduated from Computer Education and Instructional Technology at Istanbul University. I've been currently studying Management Information Systems as a master student at Ahmet Yesevi University.

### What I use? What I build?

__As a front-end developer__, I use technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, AngularJS for my daily work. I am also interested in discovering new technologies and getting information about CS concepts. I develop my own jQuery plugins when I need at project. I've been developing some web based games with [PhaserJS](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).

__As a back-end developer__ (usually for my side projects), I use [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) with [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express) for building APIs. Nowadays, I am trying GO programming language.

__In shortly__, I love building something with Javascript.

__In addition to all these__, I am experienced with Wordpress, PHP, and Python.
