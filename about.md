Hey, I am Ali, a front-end developer from Berlin, Germany. I have been working at [immmr GmbH](https://immmr.com).

### Education

I graduated from Computer Education and Instructional Technology at Istanbul University. I had been studying Management Information Systems as a master student at Ahmet Yesevi University. But I had dropped out to move to Berlin.

### What I do?

__As a person__, I am always trying to improve myself in anyway. It does not have to be related to just hard skills. So I may call myself as an [informavore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informavore).

__As a front-end developer__, I am very close with Javascript as you would appreciate. I do not discriminate any technology since Javascript is rapidly-developing. I was working within AngularJS tech stack before. Nowadays, I have been working within React tech stack. I am also interested in discovering new technologies, and getting information about CS concepts.

__As a back-end developer__ (usually for my side projects), I use [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) with [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express) for building APIs. Nowadays, I am trying GO programming language.

__In a nutshell__, I love building, getting knowledge.
